# This is a simple gdb wrapper for Piernik.  It is intended for catching
# exact place of a deadlock in a massively parallel run.  You may run it as
# you normally run Piernik, e.g.:
#
#     mpirun -host host1:,host2: ../../bin/gdb_wrap
#
# from the runs/problem directory where the "./piernik" executable is
# placed.  Each started gdb-wrapped piernik process leaves a text file named
# according to the template: bt_<hostname>_<pid>.  Then you have to wait
# till you notice that the parallel run is deadlocked, i.e.  the log files
# aren't progressing for more that few typical walltime intervals for steps.
#
# Once you realize that the deadlock occurred hou have to kill all piernik
# processes that belong to your job without killing their gdb.  You can use
# accompanying script bin/gdb_killall to kill all piernik processes on all
# hosts pointed by the bt_*_* files.  This requires that all the bt_*_*
# files are stored in local run directory and you can execute ssh commant to
# the remote hosts.  This is also potentially dangerous as the
# bin/gdb_killall script attempts to kill ALL piernik processes, regardless
# of their PID.
#
# After you successfully kill all the piernik processes from the deadlocked
# task (and hopefully nothing else), you may inspect all the bt_*_* files,
# which now should contain the backtrace from the point where the processes
# were killed.  A deadlock typically occurs when some processes have to wait
# for some other processes, while these are waiting for yet something else.
# Typically this can be identified in the backtraces as a partially
# divergent call stacks: some processes have completed certain procedures
# and went ahead while other processes are stuck few lines earlier for some
# reason.
#
# Good luck!
