!! \brief Module that implements a single sweep
!!
!! \details Here we perform 1D-solves on all blocks including proper exchange of f/c fluxes.
!!
!! When a given block has any boundary with the coarse region, all flux data
!! that has to be sent right after calculation is finished. When a given block
!! has any boundary with the finer region, its calculation is delayed until all
!! fine flux data is delivered. All communication is done quite asynchronously
!! in hope that it will nicely overlap with calculations. In some pessimistic cases
!! long stalls still may occur.
!!
!! This one is the most difficult to aggregate messages carrying flux data on fine/coarse interfaces as
!! there are complicated dependencies between grids. It is possible to calculate which fine grids should be
!! computed first in order to make critical fluxes available as early as possible.
