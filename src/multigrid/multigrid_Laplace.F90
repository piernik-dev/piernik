!! \brief Select requested routine for calculation of the residuum for the Poisson equation.
!!
!! \details Different orders of the Laplace operator result in different quality of the approximation of potential
!! * Second order (O_I2) is the simplest operator (3-point in 1D, 5-point in 2D and 7-point in 3D). Its error is proportional to cg%dx**2
!! * Fourth order (O_I4) has width of 5 cells in each direction (5, 9 and 13-points in 1D, 2D and 3D, respectively). Its error is proportional to cg%dx**4.
!!   The value of its coefficients depends on interpretation of variables (e.g. point values, integral over cell)
!! * Fourth order Mehrstellen (-O_I4) is compact (takes 3, 9, and 27 solution values in 1D, 2D and 3D),
!!   but requires values of adjacent source cells as well (3, 5 and 7 points in 1D, 2D and 3D).
!!   Its error is proportional to cg%dx**4 and tends to be smaller than the error of simple fourth order operator by a factor of 3..4.
!!   \todo check how the coefficients depend on interpretation of cell values (center point values vs integral over cell)
!!
!! Note that each kind of Laplace operator requires its own approximate solver (relaxation scheme, Green function for FFT) for optimal convergence.
!! \warning Relaxation is not implemented for the fourth order operator.
