!! \brief Variables and data structures required by multigrid routines.
!!
!! \details These variables are not meant to be accessed (or worse: altered) from the outside of multigrid routines (Fortran has no friends :-( )
!!
!! The multigrid solver relies typically at most on 2 guardcells, but the impact on performance is not big so we've decided to have it uniform with the rest of Piernik

   use constants,   only: dsetnamelen

   implicit none

   public                  ! QA_WARN no secrets are kept here
   private :: dsetnamelen  ! QA_WARN prevent re-exporting

   ! these 4 variables are required for basic use of the multigrid solver
   character(len=dsetnamelen), parameter :: source_n     = "source"      !< density field
   character(len=dsetnamelen), parameter :: solution_n   = "solution"    !< iterated solution (potential) field
   character(len=dsetnamelen), parameter :: defect_n     = "defect"      !< defect field (effectively the density not accounted in current solution)
   character(len=dsetnamelen), parameter :: correction_n = "correction"  !< correction to the potential to be applied at the end of V-cycle

   integer(kind=4) :: source, solution, defect, correction !< indices to the fields described above

   ! namelist parameters
   integer(kind=4)  :: ord_prolong     !< Prolongation operator order; allowed values are -4 -2, 0 (default), 2 and 4; -2 is often fast
   logical          :: stdout          !< print verbose messages to stdout
   logical          :: verbose_vcycle  !< Print one line of log per V-cycle, summary otherwise

   ! miscellaneous
   real             :: ts                !< time for runtime profiling
   real             :: tot_ts            !< total multigrid time
   logical          :: single_base       !< .true. when the whole base level is located on a single cpu
   integer(kind=4)  :: nsmool            !< smoothing cycles per call
   logical          :: multidim_code_3D  !< prefer code written for any 1D and 2D configuration even in 3D for benchmarking and debugging
   real             :: overrelax         !< overrealaxation factor (if < 1. then works as underrelaxation), provided for tests
   real             :: coarsest_tol      !< criterion for automagic coarsest level relaxation
   real, parameter  :: nc_growth = 1.3   !< how much ncheck grows between checks in relaxation
