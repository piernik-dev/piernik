!! \brief Module for obtaining precise parallel profiling data
!!
!! \details MPI_Wtime-based event log that will be useful for parallel profiling
!! of the Piernik code.
!!
!! General purpose profilers don't know what is important in Piernik and tend to
!! provide a lot of detailed information about irrelevant routines.
!! This sometimes adds too much overhead from instrumenting the code which can be
!! misleading. Here, the developer can choose which parts of the code need closer
!! look.
!!
!! Collecting the events should be as cheap as possible, thus we don't construct
!! any trees inside Piernik. All the collected data is meant to be used in
!! postprocessing. The developer can set up several logs, each focused on
!! different aspect of the code and not interfering with other logs.
!!
!! The profiling is turned off by default. One can turn it on by:
!! * enabling in problem.par or in CLI
!!     ./piernik -n "&PROFILING use_profiling = T/"
!!   to get the whole run profiled.
!! * enabling via user_message_file
!!      echo ppp > msg
!!   to enable profiling for just one step, or
!!      echo ppp 10 > msg
!!   to enable profiling for 10 steps.
!! Interacting with PPP via msg file will override the choice for use_profiling
!! namelist parameter and can be uset to stop profiling and flush the data to the
!! output file and continue the simulation without interrupting. The profiling may
!! be later turned on when needed. For example:
!!    ./piernik -n "&PROFILING use_profiling = T/" &\
!!        sleep 15 && echo ppp > msg &&\
!!        sleep 10 && echo ppp 2 > msg &&\
!!        sleep 1 && echo stop > msg
!! may give profiling data containing "init_piernik", first few steps, last step and
!! "finalize" (exact list depends on how long the steps are executed in the actual run).
!!
!! To exclude some categories of events one can use watch_* parameters.
!! By default MPI, AMR, debug, single-cg and auxiliary categories are excluded.
!! If an event is tagged with multiple categories, it will be excluded if any
!! of them is excluded.
!!
!! Perhaps it is possible to get much smaller output file (currently it is plain ASCII)
!! by implementing HDF5 output. I don't think it is critical as PPP profiling is
!! a debugging-type activity, not a production thing. It would require upgrading
!! python/ppp_plot.py script.
