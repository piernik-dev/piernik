!  This is minimal autobalance on hybrid CPU.  If the cores are of non-equal
! performance it should be possible to notice smaller dWallClock after
! second timestep.  For best results make sure that you use Core affinity,
! like `--bind-to core` option in OpenMPI.

!  After disabling flexible_balance, the code would stick to equalization of
! cg amount per cpu, which may be suboptimal for hybrid processors – the
! P-cores will be underutizized and E-cores would limit the overall
! performance.

!  Please note that balancing particles and hydro has limited effects
! because there are global synchronizations between these phases and no
! overlap between these two calculations can be achieved.
