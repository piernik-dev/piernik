# 2d84935c0665426247309775c20d722fd5db5f95 - 64-bit plotfiles for gold configs
# a814eac4c121262092a72a53b7378e00a1ac95e4 - more restrictive norm_tol for CR diffusion
# 8fcf05bbd76c9162eb1999d620b59dd0966e0f8e - several fixups needed for Jenkins on Fedora 24
# c21d1c15102bd2372d1006d89937a5748449403f - gdf_distance relies on GDF 1.1 (output v. 2.01)
# 0a46fa37a611365da5d84323d82b82ee38b23f7e r7683 - first non failing revision (cause unrelated to this test)
# r7647 - Changed default prolongation to direct cubic (3rd order)
# r7154 - use PSM unit set
# r7152 - use standard mcrtest problem to this validation with problem.par.build2
# r6656 - CRs source and pressure gradient given by u (instead of u1)
# r6577 - up till now, ''decr'' was added to ''ecrX'', and ''grad_pcr'' was calculated using '''modified''' fluid state. That's only a partial fix as CR source terms still use '''wrong''' fluid state (''u1'' instead of ''u'')
# r6568 - fixing CR source term in rtvd for 2D/3D (unclear if this fix is valid)
# r6533 - shuffled constants a bit, negligible change in one cell
# r6162 - grad_pcr and u(iarr_crs) update for all CR species
# r6014 - bugfix
# r5485 - after fixing ICEs with INTEL compiler
# r5345 - due to decrease of level_max from 2 to 3 in problem.par
# r4917 - due to multiplying by curl%idl instead of division by curl%dl in multigrid_diffusion
# r4586 - due to critical change in bnd_emf
