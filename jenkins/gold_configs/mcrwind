# 2d84935c0665426247309775c20d722fd5db5f95 - 64-bit plotfiles for gold configs
# e3ab64f5a94c7ee289e622078d98f5bc41eeb5ca - unifying and optimizing cr_sn procedures
# 8fcf05bbd76c9162eb1999d620b59dd0966e0f8e - several fixups needed for Jenkins on Fedora 24
# b39c890f49f76f59d8115b255581d5e04c7e4645 - Merge pull request #173 from gawrysz/IO_naming_fix: removed adding "final" to the output filename
# c21d1c15102bd2372d1006d89937a5748449403f - gdf_distance relies on GDF 1.1 (output v. 2.01)
# 06ea0b29fbfbd569a9f5acd70370ac74574a60ae - Merge pull request #93 from woolt/bnd_fix (fixed in a20b91dcd352a860e020d025be3f0895e2f58301)
# r7854 - removed explicit setting of level_depth from problem.par files
# r7711 - fixed dirty value propagation with some boundary conditions
# r7684 - minor fixes in MG
# r7649 - bumped due to reasons unrelated to this test
# r7647 - Changed default prolongation to direct cubic (3rd order)
# r7338 - Better treatment of corners
# r7169 - use different potential
# r7001 - cell centers are now calculated using slightly different formula (starting from blocks' physical edge instead of domain's edge)
# r6656 - CRs source and pressure gradient given by u (instead of u1)
# r6577 - up till now, ''decr'' was added to ''ecrX'', and ''grad_pcr'' was calculated using '''modified''' fluid state.
#         That's only a partial fix as CR source terms still use '''wrong''' fluid state (''u1'' instead of ''u'')
# r6568 - fixing CR source term in rtvd for 2D/3D (unclear if this fix is valid)
# r6548 - changing order of operations in loops (differences of the order of 10^-11)
# r6162 - grad_pcr and u(iarr_crs) update for all CR species
# r6014 - bugfix
# r5485 - after fixing ICEs with INTEL compiler
# r5345 - due to decrease of level_max from 2 to 3 in problem.par
# r4917 - due to multiplying by curl%idl instead of division by curl%dl in multigrid_diffusion
# r4586 - due to critical change in bnd_emf
